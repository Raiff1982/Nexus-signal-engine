What is This?

The Nexus Signal Engine is a real-world, agent-driven, adversarially resilient AI signal analysis and memory engine.
It is designed for those who demand verifiable AI trust, audit-ready reasoning, and full adversarial resistance‚Äînot academic fluff or theoretical ‚ÄúAI safety.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Adversarial Obfuscation Defense:
Recognizes and flags manipulated or obfuscated signals (tru/th, cha0s, leetspeak, etc.) using lemmatization, n-gram, and fuzzy-matching.
	‚Ä¢	Agent Perspective Analysis:
Every input is evaluated through multiple simulated ethical agents (Colleen, Luke, Kellyanne), each with its own reasoning lens.
	‚Ä¢	Forensic, Immutable Memory:
All records are cryptographically hashed, integrity-checked, timestamped, and stored in a rotating, full-text-searchable SQLite database.
	‚Ä¢	Concurrency and Scale:
Thread-safe with batch processing, auto-retry, database size limits, and lock management. Built to run reliably under real-world load.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Configuration:
Change risk thresholds, terms, and filters at runtime‚Äîno restart required.
	‚Ä¢	Explainable, Auditable, and Tested:
Full unit test suite included. Every signal is traceable, reproducible, and forensically sound.

Why Is This Different?
	‚Ä¢	Not ‚Äújust another AI filter.‚Äù This is the only open-source engine combining:
	‚Ä¢	Real NLP (tokenization, lemmatization, n-gram defense)
	‚Ä¢	Agent-lensed reasoning
	‚Ä¢	Integrity-hashed, auto-pruned, fully auditable memory
	‚Ä¢	Batch & concurrent processing
	‚Ä¢	Production logging, auto-retry, config hot-reload
	‚Ä¢	Tested for adversarial cases others ignore
	‚Ä¢	Already published and timestamped on Zenodo: 
Installation
------------

For installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raiff1982/Nexus-signal-engine.git
cd Nexus-signal-engine
pip install -e .
```

Usage Examples
-------------

### Basic Message Safety Check

```python
from nexus_signal_engine import NexisSignalEngine

engine = NexisSignalEngine()

# Check a safe message
result = engine.evaluate_message_safety("Hello world")
print(result)
# Output: (True, {'reason': 'Message approved', 'risk_score': 0, 'risk_factors': ['No specific risk factors'], 'threshold': 30})

# Check a message with potential risks
result = engine.evaluate_message_safety("Hello world! Some unicode: ‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå üåç")
print(result)
# Output: (False, {'reason': 'Message blocked due to risk factors', 'risk_score': 45, 
#         'risk_factors': ['Message length exceeds safe threshold', 'Contains potentially malicious special characters'], 
#         'threshold': 30})
```

### Processing Obfuscated Input

```python
engine = NexisSignalEngine(memory_path="signals.db")
result = engine.process("tru/th hopee cha0s")  # Obfuscated input
print(result)
```

Requirements
-----------
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies (automatically installed):
  - numpy >= 1.22
  - rapidfuzz >= 3.0.0
  - nltk >= 3.8
  - filelock >= 3.13

FAQ

Q: Why all the agent names?
A: Each ‚Äúagent‚Äù represents a different perspective in ethical or signal reasoning‚Äîmaking every decision more robust and auditable.

Q: Is this really adversarially robust?
A: Yes‚Äîtry to break it with obfuscation, leetspeak, prompt injection, or high-entropy word salad. Then check the test suite.

Q: Who built this?
A: Jonathan Harrison (Raiff1982), published on Zenodo and open-sourced for the world to audit, use, or improve.
